Title: 392. Is Subsequence
Difficulty: Easy
Content:
Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.
A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
  Example 1:
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
  Constraints:
0 <= s.length <= 100
0 <= t.length <= 104
s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
  Follow up: Suppose there are lots of incoming s, say s1, s2, ..., sk where k >= 109, and you want to check one by one to see if t has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

Title: 377. Combination Sum IV
Difficulty: Medium
Content:
Given an array of distinct integers nums and a target integer target, return the number of possible combinations that add up to target.
The test cases are generated so that the answer can fit in a 32-bit integer.
  Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3], target = 4
Output: 7
Explanation:
The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)
Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [9], target = 3
Output: 0
  Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 200
1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
All the elements of nums are unique.
1 <= target <= 1000
  Follow up: What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array? How does it change the problem? What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?
